# DCHP starting IP address - 192.168.0.100 subnet mask 255.255.255.0

Steps involved
--------------
1) The router is configured with the IP address 192.168.0.1 with a subnet masking 255.255.255.0
2) There is no configuration needed for switch 
3) The server is assigned with a deault IP address(IPv4) 192.168.0.1 with a subnet masking 255.255.255.0 and the DHCP server starting IP is assigned to 192.168.0.100
